# volume-control-ai
This project demonstrates real-time volume control using hand gestures with a webcam. By utilizing MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing, the application adjusts the system volume based on the distance between two specific hand landmarks: the thumb and the index finger.

When the thumb and the index finger is far away the volume will go higher.

When the thumb and the index finger is near eachother the volume will go lower.
